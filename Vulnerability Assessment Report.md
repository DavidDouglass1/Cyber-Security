# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**


## **25 January 2024**


---


# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.


# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from February 2023 to April 2023. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fc4L2azQlnUM-8r43PU9mYlT30BnxTwdjAMqpT7JeZk/edit?resourcekey=0-Q-XglnC3Li7JPK2hIvMkVg#heading=h.hvbcmqwzo9do) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.


# **Purpose**

The database server contains information about customers, vendors and employees.  There is public, private, confidential, and restricted information on the server.  This vulnerability assessment will be made to determine if each type of data is vulnerable to attack and what kind of attack surface the access control system has.

# **Approach**

We are in a competitive industry and our competitors (including overseas competitors with looser regulation on data theft) will constantly try to access sensitive data to gain an edge.  Employees can be a vulnerability due to human error so caution must be used by implementing separation of duties and the concept of least privilege for data access.  Suppliers with access to the database can often be a vulnerability if their access level is not checked and if the database isnâ€™t updated by removing old suppliers.


# **Remediation Strategy**

We can apply the framework of AAA (Authenticate, Authorize, Accounting) and concept of least privilege to assess the access level for each type of user who has access to the database.  In addition, we can apply public key infrastructure (PKI) to limit exfiltration of sensitive data.  We will review the password management system to comply with the latest NIST suggested password policy, which is salting and hashing all passwords and enforcing longer passwords to reduce risk of brute force hacking of passwords.  Applying a multi-factor authentification system will increase the security also.
