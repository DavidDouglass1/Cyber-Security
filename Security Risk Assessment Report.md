<ol>

<li>Stronger password policies, which can include some or all of the following: stronger passwords, salting and hashing passwords, and multi factor authentication (MFA).

<li>A password manager to implement and enforce these changes.

<li>Updated firewall rules control traffic and to disable unused ports.  Firewall rules can also help limit potential denial of service (DoS) attacks.

   <td>Password policies would prevent easy brute force attacks.  The company is vulnerable at the moment, especially since the administrator password is default.  Many threat actorsâ€™ first attempts would be to try default passwords for devices and systems.
<p>
A set of more robust firewall rules can make it much more difficult for threat actors to penetrate and/or infiltrate a network.  A firewall should be setup so that all duties by employees can be fulfilled.
