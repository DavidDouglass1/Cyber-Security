# Cyber-Security

## **Professional Statement**

My name is David Douglass.  I recently passed certifications in Google Cyber Security and CompTIA Sec+ and completed many projects with real hands on experience and would love to apply the skills I've acquired in a company as passionate and fascinated by cyber security as I am.  In addition to relevant technical skills such as coding and experience with industry standard SIEM tools, I bring good verbal and written communication skills and a strong sense of ethics.  It brings me great satisfaction to protect an organization from various cyber attacks and to make sure that an organization's data follows the triad of confidentiality, integrity and access, along with adhering to required regulations and laws. I have always been a great problem solver and can't wait for any problem solving challenges that may await me.
