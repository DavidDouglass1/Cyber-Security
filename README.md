Professional Statement

I recently finished certifications in Google Cyber Security, CompTIA Sec+, and many hands on projects with real hands on experience and would love to apply the skills I've acquired in a company as passionate and fascinated by cyber security as I am.  In addition to relevant technical skills such as coding and experience with industry standard SIEMs and tools, I bring good verbal and written communication skills and a strong sense of ethics.  It brings me great satisfaction to protect an organization from various cyber attacks and to make sure that an organization's data follows the triad of confidentiality, integrity and access, along with adhering to required regulations and laws.
